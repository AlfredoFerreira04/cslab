## Automated Climate Control System

This project involves the development of an Automated Climate Control System designed for the specific needs of the CISTER building. The primary goal is to smart-control lighting and heating conditions to ensure environmentally friendly usage, reduce running costs, and improve researcher wellbeing.

The system focuses on individual offices, automating two key tasks:

1. Lighting Control: Prioritizing sunlight by adjusting blinds and compensating with artificial light when necessary.

2. Heating Control: Managing temperature via smart heaters.

The system inspects and controls smart components (blinds, heaters, lights). It also features a user interface for configuration and preferences, while implementing hazard analysis and mitigation strategies to prevent failures in this critical system
